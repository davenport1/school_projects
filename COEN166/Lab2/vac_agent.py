# Title: Lab 2 â€“ Vacuum Cleaner Agent
# Description: This program wil demonstrate a vacuum cleaner
#               agent taking actions to clean or move based on a 
#               two square state 
import time
# Agent class
# Contains a list of three elements
#   first element is the state of the left square 'dirty' or 'clean'
#   second element is the state of the right square 'dirty' or 'clean'
#   third element is the current location of the vaccuum, 0 for left, 1 for right
# contains three action functions
#   suck changes the current square from 'dirty' to 'clean'
#   move_left moves the position from right to left
#   move_ right moves the position from left to right
