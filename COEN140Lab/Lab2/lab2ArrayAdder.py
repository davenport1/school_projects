# Title: Lab 2 â€“ multi dimensional array adder
# Description: This program will create two 100x100 2D arrays
#		and add them together using a loop and the + operator 
#		1000 times, recording the average times to show the differences
#		in efficiency. This program shows that the + operator
#		from numpy is several orders of magnitude faster than 
#		a double for loop method.
